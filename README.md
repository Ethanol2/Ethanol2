# Ethan Colucci
Hello, thank you for checking out my portfolio. I'm a graduate of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, or Ontario Tech University, with a Bachelor's of IT with honours in Game Development. I graduated in 2019. I've been working as a small scale freelance developer while looking for something more permanent.

# Portfolio Videos
In general I prefer to code using C#, using the Unity Engine. I have also experience in C++ and some limited practive using Java, JS and Python. I'm always looking to learn more. 

For a trailer of some of the projects in my portfolio click the video on the left. For a more in-depth look at some of my recent Unity2D projects, click right.
