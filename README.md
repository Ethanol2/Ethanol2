# Ethan Colucci
Hello, thank you for checking out my portfolio. I'm a graduate of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, or Ontario Tech University, with a Bachelor's of IT with honours in Game Development. I graduated in 2019. 

In general I prefer to code using C#, using the Unity Engine. I have also experience in C++ and some limited practive using Java, JS and Python. Or course, I'm always looking to learn more. See an edited video of some of my work at https://youtu.be/C3wEzk4uXXM
